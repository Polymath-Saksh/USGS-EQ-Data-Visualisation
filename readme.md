# US Geospatial Data Visualization

## Background

This project is to build a web application that visualizes US geological data. The data is collected from the USGS (United States Geological Survey) API. The data is about earthquakes that occurred in the past 7 days. The data is updated every 5 minutes. The map is built using Leaflet that plots the data based on the longitude and latitude of the earthquake. The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and depth of the earth quake by color. The legend provides context for the map data. The map also includes popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked. The data markers are also clickable and will redirect the user to the USGS website for that specific earthquake for more information.
